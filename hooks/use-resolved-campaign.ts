/**
 * Single source of truth for "which campaign applies right now,"
 * shared by every hook/component that needs the full CampaignConfig
 * object (not just a resolved phone number) — currently
 * `useCallAction` and the mobile call CTAs (StickyCallBar /
 * FloatingCallButton). Extracted here so the context-first,
 * cookie-fallback resolution logic exists in exactly one place.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. React context, set by `/campaign/[slug]/layout.tsx` — no
 *      flash, available on first render for anything inside that route.
 *   2. The `id_src` cookie's `campaign` field, set by middleware.ts on
 *      first touch — this is what lets Navbar/Footer/StickyCallBar
 *      (which render outside the campaign route's subtree) still
 *      reflect the campaign a visitor actually clicked through from.
 *   3. `null` — organic/default site behavior.
